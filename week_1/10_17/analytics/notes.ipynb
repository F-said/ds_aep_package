    "## Statistics & Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of data analytics and data is statistics. This field of mathematics emerged in the late 18th century in order to understand the patterns and trends of large industrialized societies(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics). According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word \"statistics\" is defined as the \"science dealing with data about the condition of a state or community\"(https://www.etymonline.com/word/statistics), hence the presence of the word \"state\" in statistics. It's no surprise then, that when we review large and rich datasets, we utilize techniques formalized within this mathematical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another field that is integral to the analysis and prediction of data is probability. This field had its roots in games dealing with chance, i.e. gambling(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_probability). The ability to quantify uncertainity in coin flips and dice rolls has found use in machine learning models, as it gives us the ability to discern \"good\" and \"bad\" models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this program we will touch on concepts in descriptive and confirmatory statistics, as well as probability. Descriptive statistics entail calculations that describe the features of a sample dataset, while confirmatory statistics aim to prove or falsify a narrow hypothesis that we define. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our scope of work for the AEP project, we will focus on providing comprehensive descriptive calculations, as opposed to proving or predicting outcomes for our dataset.\n",

    "After reviewing our understanding of statistics, we will also survey a few machine learning techniques that will allow us to perform advanced data analysis on our datasets. While your project's preconditions do not require a machine learning component, we leave this option open if you're looking for a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will review both supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning entails mathematical optimization to learn the weights and parameters that result in a model or formula that best approximates our historical data, unsupervised learning entails dimensionality reduction, data transformation, as well as clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a supervised learning algorithm would learn the optimal weights which best models the relationship between an apartments square footage and price, whereas an unsupervised model would instead be applied to a music recommendation system to provide songs that a specific user would most \"likely\" enjoy based on their listening trends.\n",

Instead, we will review the idiomatic languages and packages that we use when performing data transformations, exploratory analysis, and light statistical calculations. However this does **not** mean that you should forego basic coding skills. The ability to automate away some tedious task will make you a powerful data scientist. \n",
