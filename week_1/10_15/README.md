# Week 1 - 10/15

Welcome to the first day of the technical portion of AEP!

During these 3 weeks, we will all be working on a data science/analytics/engineering project that will be immediately applicable to a (general or specific) company or role that you would like to apply to. 

Remember! This project's utility is dictated by your interest in it as well, so be sure to choose something that **you** find interest in. Getting interested in a technical project is not a luxury we can always afford, but for personal projects, we **should** be able to speak at lengths about the motivation and outcome of this project. Most of the time, we can only do this if the project fulfills some intelectual curiosity of ours. So once again, choose a project you find interesting! 

## Analytics vs Engineering

Back in 2014, general practioners called *data scientists* were hired for a variety of roles: machine learning, general analytics, database management, and even software engineering.

Since then, the field of data science has since matured. Instead of hiring for *data scientists*, companies have now narrowed the scope of the types of roles they want to hire for. For example, instead of hiring a "data scientist" to perform engineering of data pipelines, a company might instead hire a "data engineer."

To find out more about this trend, check out [this](https://emiruz.com/post/2023-08-12-data-jobs/) blog post.

For this reason, we ask you all to choose one specific "track" within these next 3 weeks: **analytics** or **engineering**. To help you make this decision, consider that if you are interested in applying for these jobs:

* analytics engineer
* data engineer
* software engineer
* data architect

...you should choose the **engineering** track, where we will focus in on computational thinking, pipeline/hosting tools, and positive development patterns.

On the other hand if you are interested in applying to other roles such as:

* data analyst
* research analyst
* business intelligence analyst
* market analyst

...you should instead choose the *analytics* track, where we will instead focus on analytical thinking, analysis and visualization tools, and business application.

## Project Framework

Inspired by the [Nicholas Carey](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicholasgcarey_career-development-strategies-for-landing-activity-7213908274344062977-lJP9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), you will all complete a project that will have immediate applicable business value to a job or company that you are interested in.

For example, if you are interested in applying to a tech-startup that specializes in hiring travel advisors from all around the world, you could potentially help them shape strategy by comparing the number of advisors they have from each country, to the number of yearly visitors that respective country receives. By calculating these ratios, you could target potential advisors from under-utilized destinations.

With your technical expertise, you could easily see how you could use software tools to scrape data and calculate these metrics. Sharing such insight would not only show your raw technical skillset (which, without seniority, often isn't enough these days) but also your ability to apply this expertise to real problems.

We will be asking you to do the same during this fellowship and follow this paradigm of job-applications. While the original method is listed in the video linked above, the most essential steps of this process include the following:

1. Identify 1-3 companies that are actively hiring that you are interested in (Clay optional). 
2. Ideate 3 analytics (or data engineering) projects ideas for each company (LLM-usage encouraged).
3. Choose 1 project to complete, based on its applicability and feasability.
4. Complete the project.
5. Share with recruiter.

### Project Examples

To help you all ideate on the kinds of projects you can complete, check out the list of projects below. Note that you should not be recreating these template projects, but simply use them as inspiration.

**Data Science Examples**

* [Nicotine Pouch Sentiment](https://github.com/F-said/sesh-sentiment): An analysis on *Sesh* Nicotine Pouches and the sentiment of Reddit comments discussing the product.
* [Child-Care Assistance](https://github.com/F-said/ccdf-austin): An analysis on child-care trends in the Greater Austin Area.
* [Geoscraping Protests](https://github.com/F-said/kz-unrest-trackr): A dashboard on videos taken during the political upheaval of the 2022 Protests in Kazakhstan.

**Data Engineering Examples**

* [Reddit Data Engineering](https://github.com/mjcolon218/RedditDataEngineering): An ETL pipeline to pull data from the Reddit API and store into a RedShift cluster.
* [Steam Prices Data Engineering](https://github.com/edseldim/steam_prices_data_engineering?tab=readme-ov-file): An ETL pipeline to pull Steam prices for comparative analysis.
* [Smart City Data Engineering](https://github.com/edseldim/steam_prices_data_engineering?tab=readme-ov-file): An ETL pipeline to process telemetric data.
