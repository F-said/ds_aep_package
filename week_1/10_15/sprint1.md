# Project

For this fellowship you will be developing an analysis (or engineering) data project that is immediately applicable to a specific company or role that you would like to apply to. 

While the ideation portion of this project is covered under the **Project Framework** section in your `README.md` file, this document will describe the planning steps you should take before completing this project.

This includes:
* Goals: What are the main high-level goals that you are aiming to accomplish? 
* Requirements: You will notice that this section has been filled out for you. These are the baseline pre-conditions that your project should meet to be considered complete.
* Datasets: Which datasets have you identified that are pertinent to your project? 
* Tech-Stack: Which technical tools will you use?
* Risks: Which realities might hold your project back from being completed in 3 weeks?
* Solutions: How will you address each risk?
* Schedule: This is also filled for you already. This is simply the syllabus schedule. 

More information listed in each subsequent section below

## Goals

This should go beyond technical terms and accurately describe the *thing* that your project will accomplish. If you were to describe the purpose of this project to someone that does not operate in Python, or in any other technical capacity, how would you describe it to them?

For example, if you were designing a project that scraped data from multiple "predictions markets" and evaluated "market sentiment" by calculating descriptive statistics, you may state that the overarching goal of this project is to *"Evaluate and identify to which political or economic outcome the market is biased towards, by aggregating prediction market trends.*"

## Requirements
**Analytics**
* 

**Engineering**
* 

## Datasets

There are also datasets that are readily available for you to use, just ask your staff for access:
* honeypot cyber-intrusion data

## Tech-Stack



## Risks



## Solutions



## Schedule

1. Sprint 1 10/18: Project selection & planning
2. Sprint 2 10/25: Technical analysis or pipelining complete.
3. Sprint 3 10/31: Prescriptions & visualization complete.
