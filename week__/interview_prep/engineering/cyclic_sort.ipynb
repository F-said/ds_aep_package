    "\n",
    "Sometimes within problems, there are duplicates within this range, so we are not guaranteed that each number will appear in our list. However we are guaranteed that the numbers will be >= `a` and `<=` b. How can we use this fact to assist our time-complexity?\n",

    "**Example problem** : We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4.\n",
