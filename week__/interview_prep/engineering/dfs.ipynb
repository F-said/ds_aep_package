    "A tree is an object composed of nodes & connections. We start from a root-tree and then generate branches that lead to children. Abstractly, think of this as a family-tree, where the great-grandparents are at the top, the grandparents are a level below, the parents are at the 3rd level, and then finally the bottom-most nodes constitute the children.\n",
    "\n",
    "One type of tree that we will discuss today is a binary tree. This is a tree that strictly has two or less (hence the binary) children for every parent node.\n",

    "In a nutshell, we use these two algorithms when traversing a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) (a general version of a tree). This is a structure of data that entails `nodes` (focal pieces of data) and `edges` (connections between those pieces of data). This is a fascinating data-structure simply for the fact that we can represent so many real-life ideas & structures using a graph.\n",

    "Basically, if you can think of a way to connect two pieces of information or data, you have a graph. Find out more [here](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_datastruct_graph?examBoard=all&stage=all).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to traverse such a structure, we must utilize a patterned approach where we either prioritize `depth` or `breadth`. In DFS, we start at a singular node and then prioritize traveling as `deep` into the graph as we can before we hit a dead-end (or a goal node, in which case we simply stop the search). If we hit a dead-end, we then go back to the last-non dead-end node, and search its subsequent neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we see a [visual of this algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaBEKo5sM7w), the idea is quite intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundemental part of this algorithm is the [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/) data-structure, which is a First-In Last-Out (FILO) list of data. I encourage you to explore the posted links & explore the video to get an understanding of how this algorithm works.\n",
