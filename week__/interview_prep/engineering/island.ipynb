    "**Use-Case** : Often times during coding interviews we are asked to traverse a matrix. As a matrix is a structure of rows and columns, we use a list of lists to represent this as a data-structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example problem** : A popular variation of this problem is “island-count.” In this problem, `1` represents land and `0` represents water. A cluster of `1`’s therefore represent an island. How can we count how many islands appear on a grid?\n",
    "\n",

    "matrix = [\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all land-masses are connected, we have `1` island.\n",

    "    [1, 0, 1],\n",

    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, we use these two algorithms when traversing a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)). This is a structure of data that entails `nodes` (focal pieces of data) and `edges` (connections between those pieces of data). This is a fascinating data-structure simply for the fact that we can represent so many real-life ideas & structures using a graph.\n",

    "Basically, if you can think of a way to connect two pieces of information or data, you have a graph. Find out more [here](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_datastruct_graph?examBoard=all&stage=all).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to traverse such a structure, we must utilize a patterned approach where we either prioritize `depth` or `breadth`. In DFS, we start at a singular node and then prioritize traveling as `deep` into the graph as we can before we hit a dead-end (or a goal node, in which case we simply stop the search). If we hit a dead-end, we then go back to the last-non dead-end node, and search its subsequent neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we see a [visual of this algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaBEKo5sM7w), the idea is quite intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundemental part of this algorithm is the [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/) data-structure, which is a First-In Last-Out (FILO) list of data. I encourage you to explore the posted links & explore the video to get an understanding of how this algorithm works.\n",

    "\n",
    "A fundemental part of this algorithm is the [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/). If your first exposure to the English language was British English (as opposed to American English), you'll recognize this word as simply meaning \"line.\" That is, the first element in is the first element out (FIFO). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the algorithm for BFS will simply be the same thing as DFS, but just with the `queue` data-structure. Now, bfs and dfs are fundementally used for different use-cases. However, notice that they are essentially the **same** algorithm with simply one data-structure swapped out! This proves that data-structures are just as important as algorithms when it comes to engineering.\n",
